# blob-util
This is just a meteor wrapper for the npm package blob-util. On the client side, I used "cosmos:browserify" package to make blob-util work.

## API

`You can use 'blobUtil' object on both client and server side once you added this package. This object contains several useful methods.`

See [https://github.com/nolanlawson/blob-util](https://github.com/nolanlawson/blob-util) for all the documentation.
